chg_lim,Charge Limit
avoid_ful_explain,If you charge your battery to the maximum or discharge it until it is switched off, the condition and service life of the battery will be reduced. In the following you can set the minimum and maximum charge or discharge status of the battery and you will be notified each time the threshold value is reached. Avoid one fully charge and discharge your battery and extend the life of the battery.
rec_notif,Not received notification?
title_allow_bg_act,Allow background activity
allow_bg_act,In order for you to be able to use the Battery Manager without restrictions without it being unintentionally closed by the operating system, you may have to switch off special functions for battery management and battery usage in the settings. Because the various manufacturers differ in the designation of these options depending on the operating system used. In the App Information area, under Sleep or Battery, select No Restrictions or Allow Background Activity.
dev_usage,Device usage
dep_sleep,Deep sleep is a state in which your device is using the least amount of battery. The duration of deep sleep has a positive effect on energy saving. The deep sleep can be interrupted by background tasks, which causes the battery to discharge faster. In this case, restart your device.
title_bat_temp,Battery temperature
bat_tempp,The battery temperature is one of the most important factors. If the battery is kept gel at high temperatures, this affects both the service life and the performance of the battery. If the temperature rises, the internal structure of the battery can be damaged.

Before reducing the brightness, deactivate the automatic brightness so that the brightness is not changed unnecessarily.
tst_charge,Test charger
best_way_test,The best way to test the charger and cable is by checking the charging speed with the screen off. The charging speed when the screen is on is not a good benchmark because your phone is consuming power, which causes fluctuations. Plug in the charger, turn off the screen for a few minutes, and then check the maximum charge current.
